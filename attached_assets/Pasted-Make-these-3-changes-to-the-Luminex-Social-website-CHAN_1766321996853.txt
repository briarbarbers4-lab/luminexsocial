Make these 3 changes to the Luminex Social website:

=== CHANGE 1: Fix "Additional Services" Section Spacing ===

Find the "Additional Services" section (between "What We Do" and "Our Work").
Reduce excessive vertical spacing:

- Section padding-top: 60px (reduce from current)
- Section padding-bottom: 60px (reduce from current)
- margin-top: 40px (if any, reduce it)

Make spacing consistent with other sections. This section should not have more space than "What We Do" or "Our Work".

=== CHANGE 2: Show Video Thumbnails in "Our Work" Cards ===

In the "Our Work" portfolio section:

1. Ensure each project card shows the VIDEO thumbnail (not placeholder)
2. Video should auto-play on hover (muted, loop)
3. Add TWO more project cards (total should be 6+ cards)

New project card template:
```javascript
{
  id: 6,
  title: "Social Media Campaign",
  client: "Brand Name",
  category: "Video Editing",
  views: "1.5M",
  thumbnailVideo: "YOUR_THUMBNAIL_URL_6.mp4",
  fullVideo: "YOUR_FULL_VIDEO_URL_6.mp4",
  industry: "Marketing",
  platform: "Instagram, TikTok",
  challenge: "Challenge description",
  solution: "Solution description",
  results: { views: "1.5M", engagement: "14%", roi: "3.5x" }
},
{
  id: 7,
  title: "Product Demo Video",
  client: "Startup Co",
  category: "Content Creation",
  views: "800K",
  thumbnailVideo: "YOUR_THUMBNAIL_URL_7.mp4",
  fullVideo: "YOUR_FULL_VIDEO_URL_7.mp4",
  industry: "Technology",
  platform: "YouTube, Website",
  challenge: "Challenge description",
  solution: "Solution description",
  results: { views: "800K", engagement: "11%", roi: "2.9x" }
}
```

Ensure videos display properly in cards (not black placeholders).

=== CHANGE 3: Update Navigation & Add Logo ===

NAVIGATION MENU:
Remove "Process" and "Contact" pages.
New navigation order: Home, Services, Portfolio, Blogs

Header structure:
- LEFT: Company logo (add logo image or text "Luminex Social")
- CENTER: Nav links (Home, Services, Portfolio, Blogs)
- RIGHT: "Get Started" button

Logo specifications:
- If logo image exists: width: 140px, height: auto
- If text logo: font "Coolvetica", size 24px, color #F7F8FC
- Make logo clickable (links to homepage)

Navigation links should update to match:
```html
<nav>
  <a href="/">Home</a>
  <a href="/services">Services</a>
  <a href="/portfolio">Portfolio</a>
  <a href="/blogs">Blogs</a>
</nav>
```

Remove any references to "Process" and "Contact" pages from:
- Header navigation
- Footer links (if any)
- Internal links throughout site

HEADER LAYOUT (glassmorphic pill):
