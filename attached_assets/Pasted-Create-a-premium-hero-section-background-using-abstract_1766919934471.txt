Create a premium hero section background using abstract flowing hill / wave lines similar to high-end AI and SaaS agency websites.

Brand & Visual Identity (STRICT):
- Primary Dark: #0B0D12 (main background)
- Signature Royal Blue: #0D21A1 (glow highlights, accents)
- Soft White: #F7F8FC (text contrast)
- Overall look: dark, elegant, intelligent, futuristic

Background Design:
- Full-width hero background (min-height: 90vh)
- Base background color: #0B0D12
- Add smooth, organic flowing wave / hill lines across the hero section
- Lines should feel like:
  - AI data streams
  - Automation flow
  - Digital intelligence
- No sharp edges, no geometric patterns
- Use soft gradients and blur for depth

Wave Line Styling:
- Primary glow color: #0D21A1 (royal blue)
- Secondary subtle glow: slightly lighter blue (#1E3ADF or similar)
- Very soft white highlights (#F7F8FC at low opacity)
- Lines should fade gently into the background
- Layered depth:
  - Foreground waves slightly brighter
  - Background waves faint and blurred

Motion (Optional but Preferred):
- Slow horizontal movement
- Subtle parallax effect between wave layers
- Very smooth and elegant animation (no fast motion)
- CSS or SVG animation preferred

Layout Constraints:
- Background must stay BEHIND content
- Left side reserved for headline & CTA
- Right side can show more wave depth
- Ensure text readability (do not overpower content)

Typography Usage:
- Headlines: Helvetica (Bold / Medium)
- Subheadings / accents: Allura (sparingly, elegant)
- Body text & UI: Inter (Regular / Semi-Bold)

Technical Requirements:
- No images
- Use pure HTML + CSS (Tailwind preferred)
- SVG or canvas-based waves allowed
- Clean, reusable hero section component
- Optimized for performance and modern browsers

Agency Context:
- Company: Luminex Social
- Industry: AI Automation & Content Creation
- Tone: premium, trustworthy, intelligent, modern
- Avoid crypto, gaming, or neon cyberpunk aesthetics

Deliverables:
- Complete hero section code (HTML + CSS)
- Reusable background component
- Clear structure and comments
